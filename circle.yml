# checkout: checking out and cloning your git repo
# dependencies: setting up your project's language-specific dependencies
# database: preparing the databases for your tests
# test: running your tests
# deployment: deploying your code to your web servers

# Options in all Sections
#------------------------
# pre: commands run before CircleCI's inferred commands
# override: commands run instead of CircleCI's inferred commands
# post: commands run after CircleCI's inferred commands
#
# Command Modifiers
#------------------
# 
# timeout: if a command runs this many seconds without output, kill it 
#         (default:180s)
# pwd: run commands using this value as the current working directory 
#      (default: the checkout directory named for your project, 
#        except in the machine and checkout/pre sections, 
#        where it defaults to $HOME.)
# environment: a hash creating a list of environment variables set for this
#              command (see Machine configuration for this modifier's 
#              properties when used in the machine section of the file)
# parallel: (only used with commands in the test section) if you have manually
#            set up parallelism, set this to true to run a command across all VMs
# files: The files identified by the file list (or globs) will be 
#        appended to the command arguments. The files will be 
#        distributed across all containers running the build. 
#        Check manual parallelism setup document for more details.
# background: when "true", runs a command in the background. It is 
#             similar to ending a shell command with '&', but works 
#             correctly over ssh. Useful for starting servers, 
#             which your tests will connect to.

## Customize the machine
machine:
  # Set the timezone
  timezone:
    America/Chicago

  post:
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get install parallel libgetopt-declare-perl
    - sudo chown -R postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/*/lib
    - sudo chown -R postgres /usr/share/postgresql/*/extension
    - yes | sudo cpan TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP

  # Override /etc/hosts
  hosts:
    server.example.com: 127.0.0.1
    www.example.org: 127.0.0.1

  # Add machine level environment variables
  environment:
    CIRCLE_ENV: test
    DATABASE_URL: postgres://ubuntu:@127.0.0.1:5432/circle_test
    PGDATABASE: circle_test
    PGHOST: localhost  
    PGPORT: 5432
    PGUSER: ubuntu

## Customize dependencies
dependencies:
  pre:
    - bash ./build/dependencies.sh
    - perl -MTAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP -e 'print;'

## we automatically cache and restore many dependencies between
## builds. If you need to, you can add custom paths to cache:
#  cache_directories:
#    - "dummy_fdw"

## Customize database setup
database:
  override:
    - bash build/load_database.sh:
        timeout: 600

## Customize test commands
test:
  override:
    - bash build/test_database.sh
