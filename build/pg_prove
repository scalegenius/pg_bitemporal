=head1 Name

pg_prove - A command-line tool for running and harnessing pgTAP tests

=head1 Usage

  pg_prove tests/
  pg_prove --dbname template1 test*.sql
  pg_prove -d testdb --runtests

=head1 Description

C<pg_prove> is a command-line application to run one or more
L<pgTAP|http://pgtap.org/> tests in a PostgreSQL database. The output of the
tests is harvested and processed by L<TAP::Harness|TAP::Harness> in order to
summarize the results of the test.

Tests can be written and run in one of two ways, as SQL scripts or as
xUnit-style database functions.

=head2 Test Scripts

pgTAP test scripts should consist of a series of SQL statements that output
TAP. Here’s a simple example that assumes that the pgTAP functions have been
installed in the database:

    -- Start transaction and plan the tests.
    BEGIN;
    SELECT plan(1);

    -- Run the tests.
    SELECT pass( 'My test passed, w00t!' );

    -- Finish the tests and clean up.
    SELECT * FROM finish();
    ROLLBACK;

Now run the tests by passing the list of SQL script names or the name of a
test directory to C<pg_prove>. Here’s what it looks like when the pgTAP tests
are run with C<pg_prove>

    % pg_prove -U postgres tests/
    tests/coltap.....ok
    tests/hastap.....ok
    tests/moretap....ok
    tests/pg73.......ok
    tests/pktap......ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=5, Tests=216,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.06 usr  0.02 sys +  0.08 cusr  0.07 csys =  0.23 CPU)
    Result: PASS

=head2 xUnit Test Functions

pgTAP test functions should return a set of text, and then simply return the
values returned by pgTAP functions, like so:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION setup_insert(
    ) RETURNS SETOF TEXT AS $$
        RETURN NEXT is( MAX(nick), NULL, 'Should have no users') FROM users;
        INSERT INTO users (nick) VALUES ('theory');
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    Create OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_user(
    ) RETURNS SETOF TEXT AS $$
        SELECT is( nick, 'theory', 'Should have nick') FROM users;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE sql;

Once you have these functions defined in your database, you can run them with
C<pg_prove> by using the C<--runtests> option.

    % pg_prove --dbname mydb --runtests
    runtests()....ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=32,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.01 sys +  0.01 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.04 CPU)
    Result: PASS

Be sure to pass the C<--schema> option if your test functions are all in one
schema, and the C<--match> option if they have names that don’t start with
“test”. For example, if you have all of your test functions in the “test”
schema and I<ending> with “test,” run the tests like so:

    pg_prove --dbname mydb --schema test --match 'test$'

=head1 Options Details

=head2 Database Options

=over

=item C<-b>

=item C<--psql-bin>

  pg_prove --psql-bin /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql
  pg_prove -b /usr/local/bin/psql

Path to the C<psql> program, which will be used to actually run the tests.
Defaults to F<psql>, which should work well, when it is in your path.

=item C<-d>

=item C<--dbname>

  pg_prove --dbname try
  pg_prove -d postgres

The name of database to which to connect. Defaults to the value of the
C<$PGDATABASE> environment variable or to the system username.

=item C<-U>

=item C<--username>

  pg_prove --username foo
  pg_prove -U postgres

PostgreSQL user name to connect as. Defaults to the value of the C<$PGUSER>
environment variable or to the operating system name of the user running the
application.

=item C<-h>

=item C<--host>

  pg_prove --host pg.example.com
  pg_prove -h dev.local

Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the
value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix-domain
socket. Defaults to the value of the C<$PGHOST> environment variable or
localhost.

=item C<-p>

=item C<--port>

  pg_prove --port 1234
  pg_prove -p 666

Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix-domain socket file extension on which
the server is listening for connections. Defaults to the value of the
C<$PGPORT> environment variable or, if not set, to the port specified at
compile time, usually 5432.

=item C<-P>

=item C<--pset>

  pg_prove --pset tuples_only=0
  pg_prove -P null=[NULL]

Specifies printing options in the style of C<\pset> in the C<psql> program.
See L<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html> for details
on the supported options.

=item C<-S>

=item C<--set>

  pg_prove --set MY_CONTRACT=321
  pg_prove -S TEST_SEARCH_PATH=test,public

Sets local variables for psql in the style of C<\set> in the C<psql> program.
See L<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html> for details
on the supported options.

=item C<--runtests>

  pg_prove --runtests
  pg_prove -r

Don’t run any test scripts, but just use the C<runtests()> pgTAP function to
run xUnit tests. This ends up looking like a single test script has been run,
when in fact no test scripts have been run. Instead, C<pg_prove> tells C<psql>
to run something like:

  psql --command 'SELECT * FROM runtests()'

You should use this option when you've written your tests in xUnit style,
where they’re all defined in test functions already loaded in the database.

=item C<-s>

=item C<--schema>

  pg_prove --schema test
  pg_prove -s mytest

Used with C<--runtests>, and, in fact, implicitly forces C<--runtests> to be
true. This option can be used to specify the name of a schema in which to find
xUnit functions to run. Basically, it tells C<psql> to run something like:

  psql --command "SELECT * FROM runtests('test'::name)"

=item C<-x>

=item C<--match>

  pg_prove --match 'test$'
  pg_prove -x _test_

Used with C<--runtests>, and, in fact, implicitly forces C<--runtests> to be
true. This option can be used to specify a POSIX regular expression that will
be used to search for xUnit functions to run. Basically, it tells C<psql> to
run something like:

  psql --command "SELECT * FROM runtests('_test_'::text)"

This will run any visible functions with the string “_test_” in their names.
This can be especially useful if you just want to run a single test in a
given schema. For example, this:

  pg_prove --schema testing --match '^test_widgets$'

Will have C<psql> execute the C<runtests()> function like so:

 SELECT * FROM runtests('testing'::name, '^test_widgets$'::text);

=back

=head2 Behavioral Options

=over

=item C<--ext>

  pg_prove --ext .sql tests/

Set the extension for test files (default F<.pg>). May be specified multiple
times if you have test scripts with multiple extensions:

  pg_prove --ext .sql --ext .pg --ext .pgt

=item C<-r>

=item C<--recurse>

  pg_prove --recurse tests/
  pg_prove --recurse sql/

Recursively descend into directories when searching for tests. Not relevant
with C<--runtests>.

=item C<--ignore-exit>

  pg_prove --ignore-exit

Ignore exit status from test scripts. Normally if a script triggers a database
exception, C<psql> will exit with an error code and, even if all tests passed,
the test will be considered a failure. Use C<--ignore-exit> to ignore such
situations (at your own peril).

=item C<--trap>

  pg_prove --trap

Trap C<Ctrl-C> and print a summary on interrupt.

=item C<--harness>

  pg_prove --harness TAP::Harness::Color

Specify a subclass of L<TAP::Harness> to use for the test harness. Defaults to
TAP::Harness (unless C<--archive> is specified, in which case it uses
L<TAP::Harness::Archive>).

=item C<-j>

=item C<-jobs>

Run N test jobs in parallel (try 9.)

=item C<--rc>

  pg_prove --rc pg_prove.rc

Process options from the specified configuration file.

If C<--rc> is not specified and F<./.proverc> or F<~/.proverc> exist, they
will be read and the options they contain processed before the command line
options. Options in configuration files are specified in the same way as
command line options:

           # .proverc
           --state=hot,fast,save
           -j9

Under Windows and VMS the option file is named F<_proverc> rather than
F<.proverc> and is sought only in the current directory.

Due to how options are loaded you cannot use F<.proverc> for
C<pg_prove>-specific options, only C<prove> options. However, <pg_prove> does
support all of the usual libpq
L<Environment Variables|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html>.

=item C<--norc>

Do not process F<./.proverc> or F<~/.proverc>.

=item C<--state>

You can ask C<pg_prove> to remember the state of previous test runs and select
and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.

The C<--state> switch requires an argument which must be a comma separated
list of one or more of the following options.

=over

=item C<last>

Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

    # Run all tests in random order
    pg_prove --state save --shuffle

    # Run them again in the same order
    pg_prove --state last

=item C<failed>

Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

    # Run all tests
    pg_prove --state save

    # Run failures
    pg_prove --state failed

If you also specify the C<save> option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.

    # Repeat until no more failures
    pg_prove --state failed,save

=item C<passed>

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no new
problems have been introduced.

=item C<all>

Run all tests in normal order. Multiple options may be specified, so to run
all tests with the failures from last time first:

    pg_prove --state failed,all,save

=item C<hot>

Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of each
test is stored. The C<hot> option causes tests to be run in most-recent-
failure order.

    pg_prove --state hot,save

Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with the
most recently failed first use

    pg_prove --state hot,all,save

This combination of options may also be specified thus

    pg_prove --state adrian

=item C<todo>

Run any tests with todos.

=item C<slow>

Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction with
the C<-j> parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests start
running first.

    pg_prove --state slow -j9

=item C<fast>

Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

=item C<new>

Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times of the
test scripts.

=item C<old>

Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

=item C<fresh>

Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.

=item C<save>

Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called F<.pg_prove>
(F<_pg_prove> on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

=back

The C<--state> switch may be used more than once.

    pg_prove --state hot --state all,save

=back

=head2 Display Options

=over
